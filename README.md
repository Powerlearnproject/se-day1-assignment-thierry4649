#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The structured programming movement-led by Edseger Dijkstra emphasized the importance of clear, hierarchical structure in code.
2.The advent of high level programming languages-this shift made programming more accessible and reduced the likelihood of errors significantly improving productivity and efficiency in software development.
3.The rise of object oriented programming-it introduced a new way of organizing software.This paradigm shift led to more maintainable and resuable code, significantly influencing software engineering practices.
4.The agile manifesto and emergence of agile methodologies-it advocated for a more flexible, iterative approach to software development, emphasizing collaboration, customer feedback and adaptive planning.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirment 
2.Design
3.Implementation
4.Testing
5.Deployment
6.Maintenance
Requirement-gathering user needs and system requirements.
Design-creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation-writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing-conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment-releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance-providing on going support updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1.Waterfall-inflexible,changes are costly and difficult to implement after a phase is completed while Agile methodology-highly flexible, changes can be incorporated at any stage of the project.
2.Waterfall-has extensive documentation at each stage while Agile methodology- has minimal documentation, with a focus on working software.
3.Waterfall-has higher risk management due to late testing and inflexibility while Agile methodology- has lower risk management as issues can be identified and addressed early.
Waterfall scenario-in smaller,low risk projects;it works well for smaller projects with limited scope where the risks are minimal.
Agile scenario-in complex large scale projects;it is well suited for complex projects with multiple stakeholders,where frequent feedback is necessary to guide the development process.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software developer-responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
2.Quality assurance engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3.Project manager-oversees the planning execution and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development environment it provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes example visual studio while Version Control System provides tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members example Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Changing requirements 
2.Tight deadlines 
3.Technical debts
strategies
1.Effective communication 
2.Agile methodologies 
3.Priotization of tasks


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing-testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System testing-testing the entire software systems as a whole.
Acceptance testing-testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models.
Prompt engineering enhances the effectiveness,efficiency and ethical use of AI system.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt-"Tell me about climate."
Improved prompt-"Describe the main causes and effects of climate change."
The improved prompt specifies climate change and focuses on its causes and effects which directs the AI to provide information about a specific aspect of climate rather than discussing climate in general.
